## Project Context: Finnish Trainer

- This is a personal language-learning tool built in Angular 20.
- The goal is to procedurally generate Finnish grammar tasks using the OpenAI API.
- Tasks are to be stored locally via IndexedDB using Dexie.js.
- The app prioritizes minimalism, persistence, and challenge-based learning (not gamification or graphics).
- The app is evolving during daily use, and persistence of generated content is critical.
